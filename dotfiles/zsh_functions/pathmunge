# pathmunge: add a new entry to the PATH variable
#
# Usage:
#   pathmunge <dir> [before]
#     
#      This appends <dir> to the path array; if a second argument exists and is the string "before"
#      then <dir> is prepended instead of appended.
# 
#   pathmunge -r <dir>
#
#      In this usage the directory is removed from the path if it exists.
#

# do we have anything to do? 
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
   exit
fi

# Are we removing or not? 
if [[ $1 == "-r" ]]; then
   shift 
   local remove=1
fi

# make sure directory exists and is not already in PATH
# before adding it in.
local dirtoadd=$1
local position=$2
if [[ -d $dirtoadd ]]; then

    # remove any previous occurrence of $dirtoadd
    path=("${(@)path:#${dirtoadd}}")
    
    # exit if that's all they wanted us to do
    if [[ $remove -eq 1 ]]; then
       return
    fi
       
    # add the new entry; note that I am using () expansion so that 
    # any null entries are removed (possibly created in the line above)
    if [[ "$position" == "before" ]]; then
       path=($dirtoadd $path)
    else
       path=($path $dirtoadd)
    fi

    # de-dupe just in case
    typeset -gU path
  
else 

    echo "No such directory: $1"
    return 1
