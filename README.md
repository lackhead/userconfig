# Chad Lake's User Configuration

Here you will find three scripts that are used to set up my working environment on mac/linux. 

## config_macos.sh

The config_macos.sh script will write defaults to the MacOS environment to set up
things like hot corners, Finder prefs, etc. For the most part this really only
needs to be run once per user.

## config_dotfiles.sh

This installs a sparse git repo which is how I keep my dot-files in line. Please see my [dotfiles](http://www.github.com/lackhead/dotfiles) repo for the files themselves.

## config_homebrew.sh

This script will install homebrew (if necessary) and then check
to make sure everything in the Brewfile is installed on this system.
